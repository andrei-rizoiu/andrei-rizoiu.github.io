abstract = {As they search for growth, multinational corporations will have no choice but to compete in the big emerging markets of China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil. But while it is still common to question how such corporations will change life in those markets, Western executives would be smart to turn the question around and ask how multinationals themselves will be transformed by these markets. To be successful, MNCs will have to rethink every element of their business models, the authors assert in this seminal HBR article from 1998. During the first wave of market entry in the 1980s, multinationals operated with what might be termed an imperialist mind-set, assuming that the emerging markets would merely be new markets for their old products. But this mind-set limited their success: What is truly big and emerging in countries like China and India is a new consumer base comprising hundreds of millions of people. To tap into this huge opportunity, MNCs need to ask themselves five basic questions: Who is in the emerging middle class in these countries? How do the distribution networks operate? What mix of local and global leadership do you need to foster business opportunities? Should you adopt a consistent strategy for all of your business units within one country? Should you take on local partners? The transformation that multinational corporations must undergo is not cosmetic--simply developing greater sensitivity to local cultures will not do the trick, the authors say. To compete in the big emerging markets, multinationals must reconfigure their resources, rethink their cost structures, redesign their product development processes, and challenge their assumptions about who their top-level managers should be.},

    abstract = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behaviour into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics. These finding have important implications, ranging from resource management to service allocation, in both communications and retail.},

    abstract = {Social networking websites allow users to create and share content. Big information cascades of post resharing can form as users of these sites reshare others' posts with their friends and followers. One of the central challenges in understanding such cascading be- haviors is in forecasting information outbreaks, where a single post becomes widely popular by being reshared by many users. In this paper, we focus on predicting the final number of reshares of a given post. We build on the theory of self-exciting point pro- cesses to develop a statistical model that allows us to make accu- rate predictions. Our model requires no training or expensive fea- ture engineering. It results in a simple and efficiently computable formula that allows us to answer questions, in real-time, such as: Given a post's resharing history so far, what is our current estimate of its final number of reshares? Is the post resharing cascade past the initial stage of explosive growth? And, which posts will be the most reshared in the future? We validate our model using one month of complete Twitter data and demonstrate a strong improvement in predictive accuracy over existing approaches. Our model gives only 15{\%} relative error in predicting final size of an average information cascade after ob- serving it for just one hour.},

    abstract = {Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying network topology, but it also has the power to change it. Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics. We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic data and data gathered from Twitter, and show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.},

    abstract = {In recent years, study of influence propagation in social networks has gained tremendous attention. In this context, we can identify three orthogonal dimensions—the number of seed nodes activated at the beginning (known as budget ), the expected number of activated nodes at the end of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage ), and the time taken for the propagation. We can constrain one or two of these and try to optimize the third. In their seminal paper, Kempe et al. constrained the budget, left time unconstrained, and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as Influence Maximization (or MAXINF for short). In this paper, we study alternative optimization problems which are naturally motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In the first problem, termed minimum target set selection (or MINTSS for short), a coverage threshold $\eta$ is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set such that by activating it, at least $\eta$ nodes are eventually activated in the expected sense. This naturally captures the problem of deploying a viral campaign on a budget. In the second problem, termed MINTIME, the goal is to minimize the time in which a predefined coverage is achieved. More precisely, in MINTIME, a coverage threshold $\eta$ and a budget threshold k are given, and the task is to find a seed set of size at most k such that by activating it, at least $\eta$ nodes are activated in the expected sense, in the minimum possible time . This problem addresses the issue of timing when deploying viral campaigns. Both these problems are NP -hard, which motivates our interest in their approximation. For MINTSS, we develop a simple greedy algorithm and show that it provides a bicriteria approximation. We also establish a generic hardness result suggesting that improving this bicriteria approximation is likely to be hard. For MINTIME, we show that even bicriteria and tricriteria approximations are hard under several conditions. We show, however, that if we allow the budget for number of seeds k to be boosted by a logarithmic factor and allow the coverage to fall short, then the problem can be solved exactly in PTIME, i.e., we can achieve the required coverage within the time achieved by the optimal solution to MINTIME with budget k and coverage threshold $\eta$. Finally, we establish the value of the approximation algorithms, by conducting an experimental evaluation, comparing their quality against that achieved by various heuristics.},

    abstract = {Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

    abstract = {Social influence drives both offline and online human behavior. It pervades cultural markets, and manifests itself in the adoption of scientific and technical innovations as well as the spread of social practices. Prior empirical work on the diffusion of innovations in spatial regions or social networks has largely focused on the spread of one particular technology among a subset of all potential adopters. Here we choose an online context that allows us to study social influence processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of applications installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus capturing the behavior of all individuals who can influence each other in this context. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we analyze the collective behavior induced by 100 million application installations, and show that two distinct regimes of behavior emerge in the system. Once applications cross a particular threshold of popularity, social influence processes induce highly correlated adoption behavior among the users, which propels some of the applications to extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the collective effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely, in a manner that has not been observed in the offline world. Our results demonstrate that even when external signals are absent, social influence can spontaneously assume an on–off nature in a digital environment. It remains to be seen whether a similar outcome could be observed in the offline world if equivalent experimental conditions could be replicated.},

Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms—such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis—to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now significantly impact a firm's reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don't understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are defined by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how firms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.},

Due to easy access and interaction between large numbers of users, information diffuses in an epidemic style on the web. Understanding the mechanisms of information diffusion through these new publication methods is important for political and marketing purposes. Among social media, web forums, where people in online communities disseminate and receive information, provide a good environment for examining information diffusion. In this paper, we model topic diffusion in web forums using the epidemiology model, the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, frequently used in previous research to analyze both disease outbreaks and knowledge diffusion. The model was evaluated on a large longitudinal dataset from the web forum of a major retail company and from a general political discussion forum. The fitting results showed that the SIR model is a plausible model to describe the diffusion process of a topic. This research shows that epidemic models can expand their application areas to topic discussion on the web, particularly social media such as web forums.},

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88{\%} of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95{\%} of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85{\%} of cases. For the personality trait "Openness," prediction accuracy is close to the test-retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

    abstract = {One goal of statistical privacy research is to construct a data release mechanism that protects individual privacy while preserving information content. An example is a random mechanism that takes an input database X and outputs a random database Z according to a distribution Qn(⋅{\textbar}X). Differential privacy is a particular privacy requirement developed by computer scientists in which Qn(⋅{\textbar}X) is required to be insensitive to changes in one data point in X. This makes it difficult to infer from Z whether a given individual is in the original database X. We consider differential privacy from a statistical perspective. We consider several data-release mechanisms that satisfy the differential privacy requirement. We show that it is useful to compare these schemes by computing the rate of convergence of distributions and densities constructed from the released data. We study a general privacy method, called the exponential mechanism, introduced by {McSherry} and Talwar (2007). We show that the accuracy of this method is intimately linked to the rate at which the probability that the empirical distribution concentrates in a small ball around the true distribution.},

@book{Daley2008,
    abstract = {The long-awaited Volume II of the second edition of Daley and Vere-Jones' now classic book on point processes has appeared exactly 20 years after the first edition was published. It lives up to the very high standards of both the first edition [D. J. Daley and D. Vere-Jones, An introduction to the theory of point processes, Springer, New York, 1988; MR0950166 (90e:60060)] and Volume I of the second [D. J. Daley and D. Vere-Jones, An introduction to the theory of point processes. Vol. I, Second edition, Springer, New York, 2003; MR1950431 (2004c:60001)]. As stated by the authors, the second volume focuses on the structure and general theory of point processes, with the more elementary theory appearing in the first volume (Chapters 1--8). Volume II (Chapters 9--15) contains most of the material that appeared in Chapters 7--14 of the first edition, as well as a significant number of new topics. Chapter 9 presents a detailed treatment of the general theory of random measures and point processes, a topic touched on only briefly in Volume I. This is followed by Chapter 10, on special classes such as completely random measures and infinitely divisible point processes, which also includes new material on Markov properties of point processes on general metric spaces. Convergence concepts are introduced in Chapter 11. Stationary point processes and random measures are the subject of Chapter 12, with new material on long-range dependence and self-similarity. Chapter 13 is devoted to Palm theory and includes a new section on fractal dimensions. The martingale approach to marked point processes on {\{}$\backslash$Bbb R{\_}+{\}} is exploited in Chapter 14, on so-called ``evolutionary'' processes---i.e., processes that evolve in time. Finally, Chapter 15 focuses on particular properties of spatial and space-time point processes. As was the case with the first edition, each topic is carefully motivated and an extensive literature review is provided. Heuristic explanations accompany rigorous proofs, and numerous examples and exercises (without solutions) are given. While the more basic material in Volume I is more widely accessible, Volume II will be of particular use to the specialist with a good background in probability, measure theory, and topology. In his review of the first edition of this book [op. cit.; MR0950166 (90e:60060)], Alan Karr predicted that it was ``likely to become the reference on point process theory''. His prediction was correct; both volumes of the second edition belong on the shelf of any modern probability theorist.},

Can we design an online algorithm to help them decide when to post to stay at the top? In this paper, we address this question as a novel optimal control problem for jump stochastic differential equations. For a wide variety of feed dynamics, we show that the optimal broadcasting intensity for any user is surprisingly simple -- it is given by the position of her most recent post on each of her follower's feeds. As a consequence, we are able to develop a simple and highly efficient online algorithm, RedQueen, to sample the optimal times for the user to post. Experiments on both synthetic and real data gathered from Twitter show that our algorithm is able to consistently make a user's posts more visible over time, is robust to volume changes on her followers' feeds, and significantly outperforms the state of the art.},

It possesses the flexibility of applying Bayesian treatment to further improve the predictive power using a conjugate prior.

    abstract = {We present an analytical solution and numerical tests of the epidemic-type aftershock (ETAS) model for aftershocks, which describes foreshocks, aftershocks and mainshocks on the same footing. The occurrence rate of aftershocks triggered by a single mainshock decreases with the time from the mainshock according to the modified Omori law K/(t+c){\^{}}p with p=1+theta. A mainshock at time t=0 triggers aftershocks according to the local Omori law, that in turn trigger their own aftershocks and so on. The effective branching parameter n, defined as the mean aftershock number triggered per event, controls the transition between a sub-critical regime n{\textless}1 to a super-critical regime n{\textgreater}1. In the sub-critical regime, we recover and document the crossover from an Omori exponent 1-theta for t{\textless}t* to 1+theta for t{\textless}t* found previously in [Sornette and Sornette, 1999a] for a special case of the ETAS model. In the super-critical regime n{\textgreater}1 and theta{\textgreater}0, we find a novel transition from an Omori decay law with exponent 1-theta fot t{\textless}t* to an explosive exponential increase of the seismicity rate fot t{\textgreater}t*. The case theta{\textless}0 yields an infinite n-value. In this case, we find another characteristic time tau controlling the crossover from an Omori law with exponent 1-theta for t{\textless}tau, similar to the local law, to an exponential increase at large times. These results can rationalize many of the stylized facts reported for aftershock and foreshock sequences, such as (i) the suggestion that a small p-value may be a precursor of a large earthquake, (ii) the relative seismic quiescence sometimes observed before large aftershocks, (iii) the positive correlation between b and p-values, (iv) the observation that great earthquakes are sometimes preceded by a decrease of b-value and (v) the acceleration of the seismicity preceding great earthquakes.},

We find that most activity can be described accurately as a Poisson process. However, we also find hundreds of thousands of examples in which a burst of activity is followed by an ubiquitous power-law relaxation governing the timing of views. We find that these relaxation exponents cluster into three distinct classes and allow for the classification of collective human dynamics. This is consistent with an epidemic model on a social network containing two ingredients: a power-law distribution of waiting times between cause and action and an epidemic cascade of actions becoming the cause of future actions. This model is a conceptual extension of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to social systems [Ruelle, D (2004) Phys Today 57:48-53] and [Roehner BM, et al., (2004) Int J Mod Phys C 15:809-834], and provides a unique framework for the investigation of timing in complex systems.},

The available epidemic curves for SARS show marked differences between the affected regions with respect to the total number of cases and epidemic duration, even for those regions in which outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.},

The main mechanism driving content diffusion is the possibility for users to re-share the content posted by their social connections, which may then cascade across the system. A fundamental problem when studying information cascades is the possibility to develop sound mathematical models, whose parameters can be calibrated on empirical data, in order to predict the future course of a cascade after a window of observation. In this paper, we focus on Twitter and, in particular, on the temporal patterns of retweet activity for an original tweet. We model the system by Time-Dependent Hawkes process (TiDeH), which properly takes into account the circadian nature of the users and the aging of information. The input of the prediction model are observed retweet times and structural information about the underlying social network. We develop a procedure for parameter optimization and for predicting the future profiles of retweet activity at different time resolutions. We validate our methodology on a large corpus of Twitter data and demonstrate its systematic improvement over existing approaches in all the time regimes.},
