  abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to explore how complex data can be treated using unsupervised machine learning techniques, in which additional information is injected to guide the exploratory process.
The two main research challenges addressed in this work are (a) leveraging semantic information into data numerical representation and into the
learning algorithms and (b) making use of the temporal dimension when analyzing complex data.
The main research challenges are derived, through a dialectical relation between theory and practice, into more specific learning tasks, which vary from 
(i) detecting typical evolution patterns to 
(ii) improving data representation by using semantics to 
(iii) embedding expert information into image numerical description or to 
(iv) using semantic resources (e.g., WordNet) when evaluation topics extracted from text.
The methods we privilege when tackling with our learning tasks are unsupervised and, mainly, semi-supervised clustering. 
Therefore, the general context of this thesis lies at the intersection of the two large domains of complex data analysis and semi-supervised
clustering.

We divide our work into four parts.
The first is dedicated to the temporal component of data, in which we propose a temporal clustering algorithms, with contiguity constraints, and use it to detect typical evolutions.
The second part is dedicated to semantic reconstruction of the description space of the data, and we propose an unsupervised feature construction algorithm, which replaces highly correlated pairs of features with conjunctions of literals.
In the third part, we tackle the problem of constructing a semantically-enriched image representation starting from a baseline representation, and we propose two approaches toward leveraging external expert knowledge, under the form of non-positional labels.
We dedicate the fourth part of our work to textual data, and more precisely towards the task of topic extraction, using an overlapping text clustering algorithm, topic labeling, using frequent complete phrases, and semantic topic evaluation, by using an external concept hierarchy.
We add a fifth part, which describes the applied part of our work, CommentWatcher, an open-source platform for analyzing online discussion forums.}
