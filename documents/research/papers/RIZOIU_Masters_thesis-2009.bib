  abstract = {In this paper we present the research a way of clustering textual data based on the thematics approached in the texts and a manner of finding a suitable, humanly readable name for each group. Previous research done on the field of data clustering and thematic extraction is briefly presented, along with observations of their suitability for the intended purpose, and then we propose an approach to combine the ones that we consider that maximize the effectiveness of the process. Our work is intended for general text files (newspaper articles, forums, chat logs) and takes into account the fact that a text can naturally have multiple thematics, so the clustering must be done in such a fashion that this condition is respected (a text can be part of more than one group). The main idea is to regroup the textual documents using different term weighting schemes (a comparison of which will be presented later in the paper) and from each cluster extract the frequent keyphrases and associate them to the cluster's centroid. A practical implementation of the algorithm has also been prepared and an expert evaluation was performed to assess the results.}
