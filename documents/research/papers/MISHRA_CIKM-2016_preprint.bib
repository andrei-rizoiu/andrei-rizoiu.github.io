    abstract = {Predicting popularity, or the total volume of information outbreaks, is an important subproblem for understanding collective behavior in networks. Each of the two main types of recent approaches to the problem, feature-driven and gen- erative models, have desired qualities and clear limitations. This paper bridges the gap between these solutions with a new hybrid approach and a new performance benchmark. We model each social cascade with a marked Hawkes self- exciting point process, and estimate the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. We then learn a predic- tive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cas- cade history. We compare the performance of feature driven and point-process models using existing tweet data [43] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. To our surprise, Hawkes process with predictive tuning outperform recent feature-driven and generative approaches. We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. From these observations, we argue that future work on popularity pre- diction should compare across feature-driven and generative modeling approaches in both classification and regression tasks.},
