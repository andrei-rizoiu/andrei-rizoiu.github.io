    abstract = {The cumulative effect of collective participation online has an important and adverse impact on individual privacy. As an online system evolves over time, new digital traces of individual behavior may uncover previously hidden statistical links between an individual’s past actions and her private traits. Furthermore, this de-anonymization trend may not be observable when analyzing short or medium time-span snapshots of data. To quantify this effect, we analyze the evolution of individual privacy loss by studying the 13-year long edit history of Wikipedia, including more than 117,523 different users performing 188,805,088 edits. We trace each Wikipedia’s contributor using apparently harmless features, such as the number of edits performed on predefined broad categories in a given time period (e.g. Mathematics, Culture or Nature). We show that even at this unspecific level of identification, it is possible to use off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to uncover usually undisclosed private traits, such as gender, religion or education. We provide empirical evidence that the prediction accuracy for almost all private traits consistently improves over time. Moreover, we observe that the system also shows improved prediction for users who participated in the system during “safe” periods — periods where a given individual’s private traits could not be — showing that de-anonymization threats are hard to foresee as online systems evolve. Insights from this work should help users, system designers, and policy makers understand and debate the design and long-term effects of online content creation systems.},
